s34go
=====

A library for accessing Amazon S3 from Go.

Yes, this is a [solved problem](https://github.com/mitchellh/goamz). In fact, I [solved it](http://sourceforge.net/projects/s34j/) many years ago for Java (then Amazon came out with their own API). But it makes for an interesting, small-scale project to (1) see how well an object-oriented design translates to Go, and (2) play with some of Go's features.

Plus, I agreed to do a talk at the [Philly GoLang meetup](http://www.meetup.com/GoLangPhilly), and needed to come up with something.
